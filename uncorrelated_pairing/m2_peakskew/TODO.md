# To Do

* Comparisons with chi effective in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03166 .
* O3 samples only (check redshift evolution).
* Check Farah+ pairing function (they suggest that the structure appears in m_2 more prominently).
* Check resolution on q.
* Evolution with redshift?
* q-chi_eff PE plot---check if broadens or not.
